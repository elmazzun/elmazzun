Hi everybody!  
This is elmazzun, Linux enthusiast.

I deleted all of my repositories and went away from GitHub: since it has been bought from Microsoft and used my code to train AI, 
GitHub has become a pile of shit.

Also, if you do not live in the US, I urge you to use software produced in your country or on your continent: learn to detach 
yourself from large corporations, create something yourself and encourage technological, financial, and human independence from 
the big players.

See you on https://codeberg.org/elmazzun
