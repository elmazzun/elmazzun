Hi everybody!  
This is elmazzun, Linux enthusiast.

I deleted all of my repositories and went away from GitHub: since it has been bought from Microsoft and used my code to train AI, 
GitHub has become a pile of shit; not to mention the shameful support of large American companies for the suppression of democratic 
countries, the exploitation of the planet, and the financing of genocide in Gaza: however insignificant it may be, simply refusing 
to use their technologies and giving them even one cent less makes me feel less complicit in their atrocities.

Also, if you do not live in the US, I urge you to use software produced in your country or on your continent: learn to detach 
yourself from large corporations, create something yourself and encourage technological, financial, and human independence from 
the big players.

See you on https://codeberg.org/elmazzun
